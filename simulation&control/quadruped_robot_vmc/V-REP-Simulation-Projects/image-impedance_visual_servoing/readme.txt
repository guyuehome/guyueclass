How to run the simulation:
1. unzip matlab.zip
2. open but not run the scene file（Drone con due braccia - view 1） in vrep
3. run the controller simulink file to start simulation
   Note: files with prefix 'vi_ctrl' are controllers based on different control strategies.
         check your MATLAB version before simulation. vi_ctrl_XX.slx is for R2019a
         vi_ctrl_XX_r2015a.slx is for R2015a ~ R2018b
		 
enjoy!
